Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.

Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO  Nurse.


ROMEO, [rising up]
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
With blood removed but little from her own?
My concealed lady to our canceled love?


ROMEO  As if that name,

By doing damned hate upon thyself?
In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?
Romeo is coming.

Have you delivered to her our decree?


How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?

JULIET

How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?

LADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?







May not one speak?

ROMEO


ROMEO



Can vengeance be pursued further than death?

ROMEO


ROMEO



ROMEO
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?


Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?




FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?


How long hath he been there?






Romeo!--
The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
To lie discolored by this place of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?

O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?

That calls our person from our morning rest?



What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?


What fear is this which startles in our ears?









What further woe conspires against mine age?


To press before thy father to a grave?

Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
