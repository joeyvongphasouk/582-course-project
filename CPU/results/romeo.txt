Romeo, away, begone!
ROMEO
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud

GREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
sword?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Have you importuned him by any means?
ROMEO  Is the day so young?
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
BENVOLIO  In love?
BENVOLIO  Of love?
Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?
Dost thou not laugh?
Good heart, at what?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
ROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
For what, I pray thee?
BENVOLIO  Why Romeo, art thou mad?
read?

A fair assembly. Whither should they come?
ROMEO  Whither? To supper?
ROMEO  Whose house?
JULIET  How now, who calls?
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
How long is it now to Lammastide?
"Yea," quoth he, "Dost thou fall upon thy face?
"Yea," quoth my husband. "Fall'st upon thy face?
How stands your disposition to be married?
What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?
What curious eye doth cote deformities?
MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?
Well, what was yours?
trencher?
Were in a mask?
CAPULET  Will you tell me that?
Of yonder knight?
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
You are a saucy boy. Is 't so indeed?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
What is her mother?
ROMEO, [aside]  Is she a Capulet?
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
What's he that now is going out of door?
What's he that follows here, that would not dance?
What's this? What's this?
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Come, shall we go?
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
So stumblest on my counsel?
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
What shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
Shall I send to thee?
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
then?
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home tonight?
is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?
BENVOLIO  The what?
did I give you?
MERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
five. Was I with you there for the goose?
goose?
NURSE  Is it good e'en?
NURSE  Out upon you! What a man are you?
where I may find the young Romeo?
ROMEO  What hast thou found?
that was so full of his ropery?
ROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
"Two may keep counsel, putting one away"?
Romeo begin both with a letter?
O God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?
sad?
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
Let me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?
home?
What says he of our marriage? What of that?
love?
warrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Here's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
BENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?
BENVOLIO  And what to?
another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
giving?
MERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?
Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
TYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?
Is he gone and hath nothing?
BENVOLIO  What, art thou hurt?
BENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
Can heaven be so envious?
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
For who is living if those two are gone?
O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?
Which modern lamentation might have moved?
Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom?
That I yet know not?
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
But "banished" to kill me? "Banished"?
To mangle me with that word "banished"?
How should they when that wise men have no eyes?
your will?
Where's my lady's lord? Where's Romeo?
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
With blood removed but little from her own?
My concealed lady to our canceled love?
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?
But soft, what day is this?
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
JULIET  Nurse?
O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
LADY CAPULET  Ho, daughter, are you up?
Is she not down so late or up so early?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
Why, how now, Juliet?
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
What villain, madam?
What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife?
Have you delivered to her our decree?
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?
LADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?
May not one speak?
O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
Speak'st thou from thy heart?
NURSE  What?
You say you do not know the lady's mind?
Come you to make confession to this father?
Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?
CAPULET  How canst thou try them so?
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
gadding?
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
Nurse!--What should she do here?
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Because he married me before to Romeo?
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
As with a club, dash out my desp'rate brains?
What is there?
He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
again?
What noise is here?
What is the matter?
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
To murder, murder our solemnity?
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
PETER  You will not then?
FIRST MUSICIAN  What will you give us?
you. Do you note me?
sound"? What say you, Simon Catling?
PETER  Prates.--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
PETER  Prates too.--What say you, James Soundpost?
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
APOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?
How long hath he been there?
The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
To lie discolored by this place of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?
FIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?
That calls our person from our morning rest?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?

Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
