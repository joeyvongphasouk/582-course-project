PPURQ-1#1 Error
CATTRIP_PkgPin_driver_requirement  
The HBM Catastrophic Over Temperature Output signal on the PACKAGE_PIN J18 (not placed) has no signal. It is required to have IOSTANDARD of LVCMOS18 and be driven by an OBUF with an active signal or GROUND. Failure to drive the pin correctly will require a card RMA.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
18 out of 18 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: character[15:0], clock, result.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
18 out of 18 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: character[15:0], clock, result.
